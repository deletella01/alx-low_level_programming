## C - Doubly linked lists

In a doubly linked list, the head is the first node in the list. The head node contains a pointer to the first element in the list, as well as a pointer to the last element in the list. The head node is used to keep track of the beginning and end of the list, and is often used as a reference point for other operations on the list, such as inserting or deleting nodes. In many cases, the head node is a dummy node that does not contain any actual data, but is simply used as a reference point for the rest of the list.
