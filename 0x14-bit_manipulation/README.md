## C - Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulating bits.

Operator        	Description
&               	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.

|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in eather operand.

^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.

~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the efect of 'flipping' bits.

<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
